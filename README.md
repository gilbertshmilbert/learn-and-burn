# Learn & Burn

Learn about Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and test your knowledge. Take quizzes, track your progress, and create your own tests. All test scores are encrypted before being saved to the blockchain.

## What it does

This app helps you learn about FHE technology. You can read educational content, take quizzes to see how much you know, and create your own tests with random questions. When you submit a test score, it gets encrypted using FHE so your actual score stays private while still being stored on the blockchain.

- View your test scores and track your progress
- Create custom tests with random questions (30 questions available)
